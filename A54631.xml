         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I have not only cull'd out of the before-mention'd, and ſeveral other Authors, what is proper and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this Deſign; but I have gleaned from the <hi>Statutes, Law-Books, Reports,</hi> and
<hi>Hiſtories</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I met with in my inquiſitive Re-ſearches, beyond All that has been before placed in any Collection, and which may be applicable to this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking.</p>
            <p>All Members ought to be throughly skill'd in <hi>Parliamentary Affairs,</hi> to know their own <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> their
<hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:63719:4"/>they may not at any time ſuffer <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions</hi> to be made upon them, by what <hi>plauſible Pretences</hi> ſoever: but as it is impoſſible for men of the moſt tenacious Faculties to keep all things constantly in their minds, therefore this is to eaſe and refreſh their Memories in caſe of any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, and they may with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little Trouble have always this in their Pockets, which perhaps ſome may not be able without a great deal of Trouble to carry always in their Heads.</p>
            <p>When he that is converſant in Study and Books, cannot carry a
<hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary</hi> about him; he may eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect what is expedient for him, from the Supplement of this <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</hi> Such as ſhall hereafter be promoted to that honourable Station of being <hi>Senators</hi> of the
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> will find it much more eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſhort Information from this little <hi>Manual;</hi> than to be obliged on every Occaſion to conſult the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Records,</hi> and turn over weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb facs="tcp:63719:5"/>
               <hi>Volumes.</hi> And they who do not expect Admiſſion into a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Houſe,</hi> will yet receive this as no unprofitable Diverſion, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and know the admirable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of

            <p>Wherefore, without any Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Arrogance to my ſelf, I ſhall make bold to tell you, I am verily perſwaded that what I have taken pains to collect from ſeveral <hi>Books,</hi> and to digeſt into this ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, for my own Convenience and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, will conduce to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Satisfaction of all that read it; which was one main Reaſon that induced me to publiſh it.</p>

            <p>After the firſt man hath ſpoken,<note place="margin">Id.
144.</note> the <hi>Speaker</hi> ought to reſt a while, expecting whether any other man will ſpeak thereto: ſo ought he likewiſe to do after every

            <q>As many as are of Opinion that this Bill ſhall be committed,<note place="margin">Id. 145.</note> ſay <hi>Yea.</hi>
            </q>

            <p>And he ought by his Ear to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63719:100"/>judge which of the Voices is the greateſt: if that be doubtful, the Houſe ought to be divided.</p>
            <p>If upon Diviſion of the Houſe it appear that the Numbers are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the <hi>Speaker</hi> hath the caſting Voice upon all Queſtions.</p>
            <p>If it appear that the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voice be the greater,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> then ought he to put the Houſe in mind touching the naming of <hi>Committees,</hi> which is done thus.</p>
            <p>Every one of the Houſe that liſt may call upon the Name of any one of the Houſe to be a <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,</hi> and the <hi>Clerk</hi> ought in his <hi>Journal</hi> to write under the Title of the Bill the Name of every one ſo called on, at leaſt of ſuch whoſe Names (in that Confuſion) he can diſtinctly hear; and this he ought to do without Partiality, either to thoſe that name, or to the Party named.</p>

            <p>After a Bill,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which is ſent from the <hi>Lords,</hi> is twice read, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ought to be for the

            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:63719:101"/>
            <p>The Queſtion for the Paſſage ſhou'd in ordinary Courſe be then made,<note place="margin">Hakewel <hi>147.</hi>

            <p>After the Debate is ended,<note place="margin">Id. 150.</note> the
<hi>Speaker</hi> ought to put the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Ingroſſing.</p>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63719:102"/>it is the Office of the <hi>Clerk</hi> to do it.</p>
            <p>It is always to be obſerved,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> That when the Bill is engroſſed, the <hi>Clerk</hi> ought to endorſe the Title thereof upon the back of the Bill, and not within the Bill in any Caſe.</p>
            <p>So ought likewiſe ſuch Bills as come from the <hi>Lords</hi> to have Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles endorſed upon the back of the Bill,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and not within.</p>
            <p>After a Bill hath been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Id.

<hi>Martin</hi> a Member of the Houſe, made Anſwer, <hi>That the Arrest was made above fourteen days before the beginning of the Parliament:</hi> the Houſe thereupon appointed a <hi>Committee</hi> to ſearch the Precedents. And <hi>March</hi> 11. the <hi>Committee</hi> made their report of Mr.

               <hi>Martin</hi> a Member of this Houſe, arreſted upon mean Proceſs by <hi>White</hi> above twenty days before the beginning of this <hi>Parliament</hi> holden by <hi>Prorogation</hi> (miſtaken for <hi>Adjournment</hi>) and in reſpect that the Houſe was divided about it in Opinion, Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> with the conſent of the Houſe, the ſooner to grow to ſome certainty of the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the Houſe in this Cauſe, moved theſe Queſtions to the Houſe,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Whether they would limit a time certain, or a reaſonable time, to any Member of the Houſe for his Priviledge.</hi> The Houſe anſwered <hi>a convenient time.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>If</hi> White <hi>ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for arreſting</hi> Martin. The Houſe anſwer'd <hi>No;</hi> becauſe the arreſt was twenty days before the beginning of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and unknown to him that would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:63719:152"/>for reaſonable time. But the principal cauſe why <hi>Martin</hi> had his Priviledge, was, for that <hi>White</hi> the laſt <hi>Seſſion</hi> (miſtaken for <hi>Meeting</hi>) of
<hi>Parliament</hi> arreſted Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> and then knowing him to return'd a <hi>Burgeſs</hi> for this Houſe, diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Arreſt.</p>
            <p>And then afterwards Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> again returning out of his Country to <hi>London</hi> to ſerve in this Houſe, Mr. <hi>White</hi> did again arreſt him, and therefore this Houſe took in evil part againſt him his ſecond Arreſt, and thereupon judged that <hi>Martin</hi> ſhould be diſcharged of his ſecond Arreſt out of the <hi>Fleet</hi> by the ſaid Mr. <hi>White.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Both theſe <hi>Returns</hi> were brought the third ſitting of the <hi>Parliament</hi> to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Houſe</hi> by Sir <hi>George Copping</hi> being <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after that the <hi>Writs</hi> and <hi>Returns</hi> of them were read, it was debated in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Whether Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> ſhould be received as <hi>Knight</hi> for the

            <pb n="302" facs="tcp:63719:160"/>
            <p>And the <hi>Court of Parliament,</hi> after a long Debate thereupon, gave <hi>Judgment</hi> That Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> ſhould be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and their Reaſons were theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe they took the <hi>Law</hi> to be, that an <hi>Outlawry</hi> in Perſonal Actions was no Cauſe to <hi>Diſable</hi> any Perſon from being a <hi>Member</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi> and it was ſaid, That this was Ruled in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 35th of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Houſe</hi> in a Caſe for one

            <p>Another Preſident was 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Pardons of the 39th of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> and 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> had pardoned thoſe <hi>Outlawries:</hi> and therefore, as they ſaid, he was a <hi>Man able</hi> againſt all the World, but againſt the Party <hi>Creditor,</hi> and againſt him he was not. But in this Caſe the Parties were paid.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was ſaid, that Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Goodwyn</hi> was not <hi>Outlawed,</hi> becauſe no <hi>Proclamation</hi> was iſſued forth to the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> where he was
<hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> and <hi>Reſiant:</hi> And therefore the

<hi>Statute</hi> of the 31th of the <hi>Queen,</hi> which in ſuch Caſes makes the <hi>Outlawries</hi> void.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It was ſaid that the <hi>Outlawries</hi> were

<hi>Knight</hi> for the County of <hi>Bucks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It was ſaid, That by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 7
<hi>H.</hi> 4. which preſcribes the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Election</hi> of
<hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> it is Enacted, <hi>That the</hi> Election <hi>ſhall be by</hi> Indenture <hi>between the</hi> Sheriff <hi>and the</hi> Freeholders, &amp;c. <hi>that the Indenture ſhall be the Return of the Sheriff.</hi>

            <pb n="304" facs="tcp:63719:161"/>
            <p>It was alſo ſaid, That the <hi>Preſidents</hi> do warrant this Judgment, <hi>videlicet,</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. One <hi>Preſident</hi> of the 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. where Perſon <hi>Outlawed</hi> was adjudged a ſufficient <hi>Member</hi> of

                  </item>
                  <item>2. Another was the Caſe of one <hi>Fludd</hi> in the 23th of the <hi>Queen,</hi> who, being <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laived,</hi> was

                  <item>3. In the 35th of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there were three
<hi>Preſidents, ſcil.</hi> one of <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert,</hi> another of one
<hi>Killegrew,</hi> being <hi>Outlawed</hi> in 52 <hi>Outlawries;</hi> and the third of Sir <hi>Walter Harecourt,</hi> being outlawed in eighteen

                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But after this <hi>Sentence</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> of the
<hi>Parliament,</hi> the King's <hi>Highneſs</hi> was diſpleaſed with it, becauſe the ſecond Writ <hi>emanavit</hi> by his <hi>Aſſent,</hi> and by the <hi>Advice</hi> of his <hi>Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore it was moved to the <hi>Judges</hi> in the

            <p>And upon this the <hi>Lords</hi> ſent to the <hi>Lower Houſe,</hi> Deſiring a <hi>Conference</hi> with them concerning this Matter; which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> the <hi>Lower Houſe,</hi> after ſome deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, denied for theſe Reaſons:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Becauſe</hi> they had given their

<hi>Sentence</hi> upon the firſt Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay</hi> being then of the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> and of the <hi>Houſe.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Becauſe</hi> they ought not to give any

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Anſwer</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> did ill reſent, and therefore refuſed <hi>Conference</hi> in other Matters concerning Wards, and Reſpite of Homages and Purveyors; and alſo
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:63719:162"/>they ſent to the King to inform him of it: but before their <hi>Meſſengers</hi> came to the King, two of the <hi>Privy Council, ſcilicet,</hi> Sir <hi>John Stanhope,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Herbert,</hi> were ſent to the <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Lower Houſe,</hi> to inform him that they had heard that his <hi>Grace</hi> was diſpleaſed with the <hi>Houſe</hi> for their <hi>Sentence</hi> given for Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn,</hi> as well as in the Matter of the <hi>Sentence,</hi> which was, (as they heard) ſaid to be againſt <hi>Law;</hi> as alſo for the manner of their <hi>Proceedings,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done haſtily, without Calling to it either Sir <hi>John Forteſcue,</hi> or his <hi>Council,</hi> or without making his
<hi>Grace</hi> acquainted with it.</p>
            <p>And therefore they deſired his <hi>Grace</hi> to underſtand the <hi>Truth</hi> of this <hi>Matter,</hi> and alſo told him that
<hi>They</hi> were ready, with his good leave, with their <hi>Speaker,</hi> to attend his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to give him <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> about their
<hi>Proceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>King</hi> told them they came too late, and that it ought to have been done ſooner, calling the <hi>Houſe Raſh</hi> and
<hi>Inconſiderate;</hi> but yet notwithſtanding he was content to hear their <hi>Speaker</hi> in
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:63719:162"/>the Morning at Eight of the Clock.</p>
            <p>Upon this Meſſage <hi>Committees</hi> were choſen to conſider of the <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Matters</hi> aforeſaid, which ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the King in <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of the

            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In the <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> of their

               <item>2. In the <hi>Preſidents,</hi> which were thoſe I before have reported.</item>
               <item>3. And in <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Law.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Which were thoſe Matters of <hi>Law</hi> alſo before reported by me; with another Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>That in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, the <hi>Speaker</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> was Arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Execution</hi> at the Suit of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York;</hi> and the <hi>Queſtion</hi> being put to the <hi>Judges</hi> at that time, Whether the <hi>Speaker</hi> ought to have his <hi>Priviledge:</hi> It was ſaid by them, <hi>That they were</hi> Judges
<hi>of the</hi> Law, <hi>and not</hi> Judges <hi>of</hi> Parliament.</p>
            <pb n="308" facs="tcp:63719:163"/>
            <p>The <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> were the free
<hi>Election</hi> of the County, the Requeſt of one of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> the double Return of the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> with a Commemoration of the length of the time ſince the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawries,</hi> and with that the Payment of the
<hi>Debts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>Report</hi> the <hi>King</hi> anſwered, That he now ought to <hi>change</hi> his <hi>Tune</hi> which he uſed in his firſt
<hi>Oration, ſcilicet, Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> to <hi>Grief</hi> and
<hi>Reproof.</hi> But he ſaid, That it was as neceſſary they ſhould be Reproved, as Congratulated; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cited a parcel of
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> wherein God had ſo done with his <hi>People Iſrael,</hi> nay, with King <hi>David,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom he tendered as the <hi>Apple</hi> of his <hi>Eye,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> who was a
<hi>Man</hi> after his own <hi>Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſaid, That ſince Sir <hi>Francis Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi> was received by the Houſe upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Motives inducing the Houſe thereunto, ſo the King upon Reaſon too, took conſideration of Sir <hi>John Forteſcue,</hi> being one of the <hi>Council,</hi> an ancient
<hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor;</hi> a <hi>Counſellor</hi> not choſen by the
<hi>King,</hi> but by his <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> and ſo he
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:63719:163"/>found him; and therefore he endeavoured to grace him, being the only Man of them that had been diſgraced; the King proteſting that he would not for any thing in the World, offer
<hi>unjuſtly</hi> any <hi>Diſgrace</hi> to any Man in the <hi>Nation.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he did not proceed Raſhly, as they had proceeded, but upon
<hi>Deliberation</hi> with <hi>double Advice,</hi> as well with that of his
<hi>Council,</hi> as with that of his <hi>Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in his Anſwering the <hi>Preſidents,</hi> he ſaid, That thoſe were his own proper <hi>Records,</hi> and to uſe them againſt
<hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> was over-great <hi>Weenings:</hi> But in
<hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents,</hi> he ſaid, that they ought to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Times</hi> and <hi>Perſons;</hi> and therefore ſaid, That <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth's Time was <hi>troubleſome,</hi> he himſelf <hi>Weak</hi> and
<hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> And as for the <hi>other Preſidents,</hi> they were in the Time of a <hi>Woman,</hi> which <hi>Sex</hi> was not capable of <hi>Mature Deliberation;</hi> and ſo he ſaid where <hi>Infants</hi> are Kings, whom he called <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Law part,</hi> he referred to the <hi>Anſwer</hi> of his <hi>Judges,</hi> who by the <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> gave theſe

               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:63719:164"/>they all unanimouſly agreeing in
<hi>Them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>King alone,</hi> and not the <hi>Parliament Houſe,</hi> had to do with the <hi>Returns</hi> of the <hi>Members</hi> of
<hi>Parliament;</hi> for from him the <hi>Writs</hi> iſſued, and to him the
<hi>Sheriff</hi> is commanded to make his <hi>Returns;</hi> but when a Man is
<hi>Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>Sworn,</hi> the <hi>Parliament Houſe</hi> hath to do with <hi>Him,</hi> and the <hi>Sheriff</hi> ought to Return the
<hi>Outlawry,</hi> if he knew it before his <hi>Return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They <hi>Reſolved</hi> clearly, That an <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed Perſon</hi> cannot by the <hi>Law</hi> be a <hi>Member</hi> of the

<hi>Refuſe</hi> the <hi>Return</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi> and for that Cauſe he was <hi>removable</hi> out of the <hi>Houſe.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> ſaid, That in the 35th of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth it was ſo <hi>Adjudged</hi> in <hi>Parliament;</hi> which anſwers the
<hi>Preſidents</hi> vouched by the <hi>Commons</hi> of that time. And alſo he ſaid, That in the <hi>firſt year</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth it was <hi>Adjudged</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> That <hi>Perſons Outlawed</hi> or <hi>Attainted</hi> could

<hi>Reſtitution</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> And he ſaid, That though the <hi>Books</hi> do not warrant his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet the
<hi>Parliament Roll</hi> (which he had ſeen) does warrant it, which any Man might ſee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They <hi>Reſolved</hi> at the <hi>Instance</hi> of the

            <p n="4">4. As for the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 31th of the

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:63719:168"/>being thrice read, they proceed to the

            <p>As to the <hi>Houſe</hi>'s not having uſed the King
<hi>well,</hi> the thing being done by his <hi>Command;</hi> they ſay, That they had no <hi>Notice</hi> before their <hi>Sentence,</hi> that the King himſelf took any ſpecial <hi>Regard</hi> of that <hi>Caſe,</hi> but only that his <hi>Officer,</hi> the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> had directed the

            <p>As to the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Outlawry, They</hi> ſaid,
<hi>That</hi> they underſtand by his <hi>Royal Perſon</hi> more ſtrength and light of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> from it than ever before: and yet it was
<hi>without Example,</hi> That any <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> was put out of the <hi>Houſe</hi> for any ſuch <hi>Cauſe;</hi> but to prevent that, they had prepared a <hi>Law,</hi> That no <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed Perſon</hi> for the time to come ſhould be of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor any

            <pb n="319" facs="tcp:63719:168"/>
            <p>But they ſaid further, That Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn</hi> was not
<hi>Outlawed</hi> at the Day of his <hi>Election,</hi> for he was not
<hi>Quinto Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actus,</hi> the five <hi>Prolamations</hi> never had been made, which <hi>Proclamation</hi> they in <hi>London</hi> always ſpare, except the
<hi>Party,</hi> or any for him, <hi>require</hi> it; and that <hi>Exigent</hi> was never <hi>Returned,</hi> nor any <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Certiorari</hi> directed to the <hi>Coroners</hi> to certifie it, but after his
<hi>Election,</hi> which was a thing <hi>unuſual,</hi> the Money being paid, the Sheriffs being long ſince dead, to <hi>Diſenable</hi> the ſaid
<hi>Goodwyn</hi> to ſerve in <hi>Parliament,</hi> that the <hi>Exigent</hi> was <hi>return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and the <hi>Names</hi> of the deceaſed She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs put thereto. <hi>Et ex hoc fuit</hi> without doubt that <hi>Goodwyn</hi> could not have a <hi>Scire Facias,</hi> for there was no <hi>Outlawry</hi> againſt him, and by <hi>Conſequence</hi> the <hi>Pardons</hi> had diſcharged him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>They</hi> farther ſhewed to the <hi>King,</hi> That if the <hi>Chancellour only</hi> could examine <hi>Returns,</hi> then upon
<hi>every Surmiſe,</hi> whether it were <hi>True</hi> or <hi>Falſe,</hi> the <hi>Chancellour</hi> might ſend a <hi>Second Writ,</hi> and cauſe a

               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:63719:169"/>of the <hi>County</hi> ſhould be

            </p>
            <p>For by ſuch means the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Council</hi> might make <hi>Any Man, whom they would, to be of the Parliament Houſe,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>great Charter</hi> and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of
